## Ryder_But_Cool Commission Prices

*All prices are subject to change depending upon design complexity.*

*There's a lot of maths here.*

*I will calculate the price for you if you just tell me what Framing, Polish, Background options you want, along with the things you'd like me to draw, preferably with a reference photo or detailed description if you don't have a reference photo.*

What I will draw/paint:
- Furries (Anthro and Feral)
- Humans (Original Characters, Characters from shows, selfies, family/friends, etc.)
- Pets
- SFW and NSFW*
- Landscapes
- Drawovers of a photo
- Anything, really! Just ask if you're curious about something else! :)

*Nothing depicting illegal or immoral acts. Conviction at artist's discretion.

# Framing
(*The Maximum Amount you may be paying depending on the Polish Quality*)

- Headshot/Bust: $20

- Waist: $35

- Full Body: $50

# Polish 
(*Determines the Framing Price. Eg. Waist Shot with Simple Shading, $35 x 0.75 = $26.25, rounded to $26*)

- Sketch: 1/4 (So, multiply the Framing price by 0.25)

- Line Art: 1/2 (0.5)

- Flat Colour: 2/3 (0.67)

- Simple Shading: 3/4 (0.75)

- Fully Shaded: 1/1 (Full Price, essentially)

- Painted: 1.3 (30% on top of Full Framing Price, multiply the Framing Price by 1.3)

# Background
(*An extra payment on top of the Framing*)

- No Background/Thicker Outline on Character: Nothing

- Gradient/Abstract: $2 - $5

- Scene: $10 - $25 (Complex scene increases price)

# Extra

- Additional Characters after the First character are at 1/2 the price - Unless piece has 5+ characters, where every character after the fifth is at 1/4 price. Example. A piece with one character, Full Body, Fully Shaded, and no background, would be around $50. *If* an additional character were added, with the same Framing, Polish, and Background options as the first, it would add on 1/2 the price. $50 from the original character, $25 from the additional character ($50 รท 0.5 = $25), altogether the piece is $75.
  
- I have the right to refuse any commissions without giving a reason. If for any reason I cannot complete your commission, and you'd already paid some or all of it, all of what you'd paid will be refunded.
  
- I will not send the finished commission until the full payment has been made. Same with any check ups, if you'd only paid enough for a sketch when you ask for a checkup on the commission, I would only send you the sketch. Don't think this means you need to get the money to me right away, though! Life happens. I am happy to wait :) 


If there's anything else I haven't answered here, please do ask me! I am happy to answer any questions. Thank you for reading this all! I love yapping.
